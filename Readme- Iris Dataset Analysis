# 🌸 Iris Dataset Analysis – Power BI Dashboard

An interactive **Power BI dashboard** built using the classic **Iris Dataset** to analyze and visualize relationships between sepal and petal dimensions across different iris species.

This project demonstrates **data cleaning, aggregation, and visualization skills** using Power BI and is ideal for beginners in data analytics and visualization.

---

## 📊 Project Overview

The Iris dataset contains measurements of iris flowers from three species:

* **Setosa**
* **Versicolor**
* **Virginica**

Each record includes:

* Sepal Length
* Sepal Width
* Petal Length
* Petal Width

The goal of this project is to:

* Understand differences between species
* Identify patterns and trends
* Present insights through an interactive dashboard

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Raw datasets are often difficult to interpret without visualization. This project solves the problem of **understanding species-wise variation** in iris flower measurements by transforming raw data into **clear and interactive visual insights**.

---

## 🧠 Why This Dataset?

* Well-structured and clean dataset
* Widely used in data science and ML
* Perfect for learning **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)**
* Helps understand how visualizations reveal hidden patterns

## 📈 Dashboard Highlights

The Power BI dashboard includes:

### 1️⃣ Average Sepal & Petal Size by Species

* Bar charts comparing average dimensions
* Clear differentiation between species

### 2️⃣ Trend of Sepal vs Petal Length

* Line/area visualization
* Shows how petal length varies with sepal length

### 3️⃣ Species Distribution

* Donut chart showing equal distribution of species

### 4️⃣ Comparison of Sepal & Petal Dimensions

* Combined bar and line chart
* Easy comparison of measurements

### 5️⃣ Sepal Length vs Petal Length (Scatter Plot)

* Strong clustering by species
* Highlights correlation between features
